BUGS and LIMITATION:
    1. currently works only for unix-like systems
    2.  Rather slow: on a 15Mb tag file (jdk src) it take 8s to open defalul package
           for ather packages it is a bit faster (no more then 2s)
    3. opens java files only in case tag file was generated with relative paths.
 
WITHOUT YOUR FEEDBACK IT WON'T BE IMPROVED,
